Using Lag Lead

  Problem:
Sometimes in tasks there is a need to get chains of dependencies by sorted column between the current and the previous (or subsequent) row.
Usually, while standing such chains, another column appears with the previous or subsequent value. For example, in the case of dates, for a given row, you can get the validity period of the data in it.
For this case need to use LEAD and LAG.
